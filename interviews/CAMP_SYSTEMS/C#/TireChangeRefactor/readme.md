               Coding Exercise
----------------------------------------------

Thanks for applying to CAMP!  We actively seek out
engineers with a passion for our craft, and are 
always finding ways to improve our code and ourselves.
This coding exercise is a simple refactoring exercise
for some code that could use a little improvement.

Refactor the "GetAllAircraftDueForTireChange" function
in MaintenanceService.cs.  If you are selected for a phone screen, 
please be prepared to discuss your solution.

Notes:
    - While there is no time limit, this coding exercise should only take about 5-15 minutes.
    - Writing tests is not required
    - To test your code, launch the index.html file in a browser.  It will display a simple PASS or FAIL indicator.
    - Assume the data will always be available and "good" data.
    - Nothing in this refactoring exercise is designed to trick you.
    - Have fun!
